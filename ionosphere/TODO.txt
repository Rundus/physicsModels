[1] Check the recombination rates in PlasmaEnvironment
        there's large discrepancies between the two available models
[2] Cross-check the conductivity model with Leda2019 model
        use the IRI model data from Leda2019 and try to reproduce their results
[3] Implement a way to use raw diffNFlux data in the Fang2009 parameterization
        The energy flux for a specific energy channel

[item] The specific conductivities appear large

[item] Calculate height-integrated Hall/Pedersen with robinson formulae

[item] Calculate height-integrated Hall/Pedersen with Kaeppler 2023 Formulae

[item] Average the LP values when sampling for the ni_spectrum. (Currently just downsampling --> can lead to random spikes)

[item] Cross-check the conductivity model with Leda2019 model
        -use the IRI model data from Leda2019 date/times to reproduce their results

[item] Determine a more realistic recombination rate for the ionization/recombination section

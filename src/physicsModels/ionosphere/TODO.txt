[1] Cross-check the conductivity model with Leda2019 model
        -use the IRI model data from Leda2019 date/times to reproduce their results
        -There's something strange with the magnitude of the collision frequencies
[2] Check the LP ni_spectrum for accuracy when collecting quiet/active regions

[3] adjust ni_spectrum for the ratio of electrons/ions from the ISR data

[4] Determine why the hall/Pedersen conductivities do NOT appear to decay in altitude (not really)

[5] Determine a more realistic recombination rate for the ionization/recombination section

[6] Omni-directional flux or parallel flux for the ionization?
        -Currently, none of the perpendicular flux is used to calculate ionization
        -Read Kaeppler's thesis on his choice?
